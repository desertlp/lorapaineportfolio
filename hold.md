                <p>Iâ€™m a full stack developer with a background in clean energy. Like energy conservation, coding is a science that requires focus and unconventional thinking to solve unique problems, and that is why I love what do what I do.</p>
                <p>Check out my projects below for more insight into my style. Django + Python might just be my favorite, electric cars and the desert closely follow.</p>
                <p>Cheers!</p>
